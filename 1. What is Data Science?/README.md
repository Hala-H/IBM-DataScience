<h1> About this Course <h1> 
<p> The art of uncovering the insights and trends in data has been around since ancient times. 
The ancient Egyptians used census data to increase efficiency in tax collection and they accurately predicted 
  the flooding of the Nile river every year. Since then, people working in data science have carved out a unique
  and distinct field for the work they do. This field is data science. In this course, we will meet some data science
  practitioners and we will get an overview of what data science is today.</p>
