<h2> Week 1 - Python Basics </h2>
<p> This module teaches the basics of Python and begins by exploring some of the different data types such as integers, real numbers, and strings. 
  Continue with the module and learn how to use expressions in mathematical operations, store values in variables, and the many different ways to manipulate strings. </p>

<h2> Week 2 - Python Data Structures </h2>
<p> This module begins a journey into Python data structures by explaining the use of lists and tuples and how they are able to store collections of data in a single variable. 
  Next learn about dictionaries and how they function by storing data in pairs of keys and values, and end with Python sets to learn how this type of collection can appear in 
  any order and will only contain unique elements.</p>

<h2> Week 3 - Python Programming Fundamentals </h2>
<p> This module discusses Python fundamentals and begins with the concepts of conditions and branching. Continue through the module and learn how to implement loops to 
  iterate over sequences, create functions to perform a specific task, perform exception handling to catch errors, and how classes are needed to create objects. </p>

<h2> Week 4 - Working with Data in Python </h2>
<p> This module explains the basics of working with data in Python and begins the path with learning how to read and write files. Continue the module and uncover the best
  Python libraries that will aid in data manipulation and mathematical operations. </p>

<h2> Week 5 - APIs and Data Collection </h2>
<p> This module delves into the unique ways to collect data by the use of APIs and webscraping. It further explores data collection by explaining how to read and collect data
  when dealing with different file formats. </p>
